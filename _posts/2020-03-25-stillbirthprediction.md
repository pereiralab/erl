Until now, there has been no quantitative risk assessment tool for stillbirth. We developed a stillbirth prediction model that takes risk factors - like sociodemographics, chronic disease, obstetric history and current pregnancy complications - and uses them to predict stillbirth. If we are willing to allow 10% false positives, our model indicates that we can predict more than half of all stillbirths. There is still a huge amount of work to do. It is currently being evaluated in a clinical setting in Sydney. We also continue to make further improvements. The [media release](https://news.curtin.edu.au/media-releases/curtin-research-could-help-doctors-predict-and-prevent-stillbirth/) is here.
