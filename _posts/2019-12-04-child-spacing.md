The World Health Organization and obstetric societies worldwide advise against conceiving again too soon after giving birth to a live born child. Is this advice relevant to avoid increased risk of gestational diabetes, a relatively prevalent pregnancy complication in Australia? According to our PhD candidate, Amanuel Gebremedhin, probably not. The [media release](https://news.curtin.edu.au/media-releases/conceiving-within-six-months-of-birth-does-not-increase-risk-of-diabetes/) is here.
