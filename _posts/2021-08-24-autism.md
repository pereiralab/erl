Autistic spectrum disorder is a developmental disability that is generally thought to have genetic origins. There is no compelling evidence to suggest that vaccination causes increased risk. However, non-genetic causes (other vaccination) still contribute to risk. We conducted an international study that demonstrates increased risks for both short and long interpregnancy intervals. There is strong evidence that there is an environmental cause of soem kind. Whether the observed effects reflect pregnancy spacing alone remains unclear because of the large changes in estimates after control for potential confounders. The following figure shows the extent to which associations between interpregnancy intervals and autistic spectrum disorder changes after control for socioeconomic, psychiatric and latent (unobserved) confounders. An interretation of this discovery is that the effects of short IPI have been overstated and demonstrates the relative importance of the effects of long IPI (possibly via biological aging).
