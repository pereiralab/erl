"More research is needed", "Further research is needed" has become a common scientific clich√©. It is difficult to think of any situation for which more research is not needed. All scientific findings require replication, either in a controlled environment or in other settings and sub-populations. Studies must also be repeated by independent research teams or investigators. Without replication how else can the research be deemed credible.
